    Many people have never had to shop for health insurance. An   employer often provides it. But if you have to buy health insurance on your own,   it&rsquo;s important to understand the process.

      <h2>What is individual health insurance?</h2>
      Individual health insurance is coverage you purchase on your own, directly from an insurance company or insurance agent* (versus group insurance, which you typically receive through your employer).<BR>
      <BR>
      If you’re an early retiree, self-employed or on COBRA, you can purchase major medical health insurance to help protect yourself and your family against health care costs and get access to care. You pay the entire premium each month; your employer makes no contributions.


      <h2>How is my medical history   reviewed?</h2>
      With individual health insurance, you are not guaranteed coverage, which is unlike an employer’s plan. Based on your current and past health, it’s possible to be declined, or offered coverage at a higher premium.<BR>
      <BR>
      On your application, you’ll be asked to submit medical information. Your application will then pass through the insurer’s “medical underwriting” process, which evaluates the costs of insuring you and determining if you’re eligible for coverage. Then you’ll either be accepted, denied or accepted with a “preexisting condition” waiting period before a current or past health condition can be covered. You may also receive coverage at a higher-than-quoted rate due to pre-existing medical conditions.
    <h2>Can I keep my doctors?</h2>
      Quality individual health insurance lets you visit   any
      doctor or hospital you choose, without a referral.
      Note, however, that   you&rsquo;ll pay less out of your own
      pocket if you see doctors and hospitals in   the
      insurer&rsquo;s participating network.<BR>
      <BR>
      It’s helpful to choose an insurer with a large, nationwide network of doctors and hospitals. This ensures when you travel, you’ll have access to participating doctors and hospitals.<BR>

      <BR>
      Many insurance   companies offer a choice of major medical plans,
      some with prescription   coverage and some without. Based on
      prescriptions you take now or have taken   in the past, you may
      be offered coverage at a higher-than-quoted rate, or   possibly be
      denied coverage.<BR>
      <p>Be sure to check how an insurer covers   preferred, non-preferred
      and generic prescription drugs, because plan details   may differ.</p>
    <h2>Can I cover my dependents?</h2>
      Quality individual health insurance may allow you
      to   add a dependent spouse and/or dependent
      children up to age 26 to your   policy.
      <p>
      Unlike employer-based plans, individual insurance requires   each
      family member to go through separate &ldquo;medical underwriting,&rdquo;
      which   evaluates the costs of insuring and determining eligibility
      for   coverage.</p>
    <h2>What is a Health Savings Account?</h2>
      A Health Savings Account, or HSA, is a   tax-advantaged
      account that helps cover your current and future
      medical   expenses. It is designed to be combined with
      a High-Deductible Health   Insurance Plan.
      <p>
      An HSA has three tax advantages: You and/or your   family
      members make contributions to your HSA tax-free. That money
      earns   interest tax-free. And withdrawals you make for medical
      expenses are   tax-free.
      Any money you haven&rsquo;t used at the end of the plan year   rolls
      over to the next year. You never lose it because you own your
      HSA.   If you are 55 or older (until you enroll in Medicare), you
      can make   additional catch-up contributions to your HSA.
      When you open an HSA   (typically from a financial institution
      that offers these types of accounts),   you pair it up with a HighDeductible individual health insurance plan that is   specifically
      designated as &ldquo;HSA-compatible.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>There are many health coverage options available. You   might have insurance through an employer. Or you might start your coverage with   InsFilings. Either way, knowing the basics will help you to get the most out of   your health insurance coverage.</p>
