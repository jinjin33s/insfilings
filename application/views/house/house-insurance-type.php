        <h2>Protecting Your Home &amp; Personal Property with   Insurance</h2>
        At your home, you rely on having a safe, comfortable place   to live. When you purchase a home insurance policy, it should contain a   description of your home's structure and a list of excluded events that may not   included. It's important to ensure you understand what in included in your   coverage and any additional options you may want to consider.<br />
        <h2>Your   Residence Type Matters</h2>
        Structures vary so widely that a different   policy is usually required for each type of home. For instance...<br />
        <ul>
            <li>A   Condo policy typically covers interior structures like wallboard and lighting   fixtures. Depending on your state, your association by-laws, and insurer,   external walls may not be covered.</li>
            <li>Within a Home insurance policy,   usually a home's entire structure is covered along with sheds and detached   garages.</li>
            <li>For Manufactured Homes, the entire structure is usually   covered, while sheds and garages may require an optional policy.</li>
            <li>A   Renters insurance policy typically has no physical structure coverage at all,   but it often provides essential liability and contents coverage.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Most   Unfortunate Events are Covered</h2>
        Most insurance companies offer   coverage for the same events that may damage the structure of your home,   including fire, smoke, lightning, wind, hail, frozen plumbing, theft, explosion,   vandalism, the weight of ice and snow, and a few others.<br />

        <h2>Excluded   Events are Named in the Policy</h2>
        Typically, floods and earthquakes are   excluded from basic policies, but in some areas, you may be able to get   supplemental insurance policies for those situations. A few other conditions   most companies specifically exclude are mold, fungus, wet rot, dry rot and   bacteria. </p>

            <p><span class="subtitle_s">2. Insuring Your Personal Property</span></p>
            
        You've made a significant investment in your possessions, and they need to be   protected. Read about category limits and per item limits that could affect the   amount you generally are paid for covered lost or damaged personal items.
        <div jquery1294850435186="12">
        <h2>How to Choose Personal Property   Coverage</h2>
        Do you know how much your belongings are worth? The figure is   often much more than our customers initially think. Taking the time to assess   what you own, and to understand how your coverage works, can help you make sure   everything you value is adequately covered.<br />
        <br />
        Start by walking around your   home and look for items that you spent a lot of money on, or that have   appreciated in value since you got them. Having a record of those items   (pictures, documents, etc.) - especially those most important to you either   financially or personally, is very important in working to ensure they are   protected properly.<br />

        <h2>Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement   Cost</h2>
        Actual Cash Value and Replacement Cost coverage options   refer to different ways your belongings may be replaced in the event of a   covered loss. Many of your belongings will decrease in value over time, so it's   important to consider this when you purchase coverage for protecting your   personal property.<br />

        <h2>Actual Cash Value Coverage</h2>
        Your personal   property is typically covered for what you might expect to get if you sold it at   fair market value - possibly at a garage sale, online auction site or other   sales event - as replacement cost minus depreciation. <br />

        This coverage   option may allow for the insured item to be replaced with a used item but not   always a new one. Premiums for Actual Cash Value insurance coverage though   generally cost less than those for the Replacement Cost coverage option. <br />

        <h2>Replacement Cost Coverage</h2>
        With Replacement Cost coverage,   your insured personal property items are usually covered for what it costs to   buy them again at the time of the claim as new, although premiums for this type   of insurance are typically higher than the Actual Cash Value insurance coverage   option.<br />

        <h2>Item Categories and   Limits</h2>
        Insurance companies often group certain kinds of things   into categories - and sometimes assign maximum amounts that can be paid to   replace all of the items or even single items in the category. Your total   property limit may give you the impression you have plenty of coverage, but you   may find that your category limit on computers isn't nearly enough to replace   all of the computers in your home.<br />
        <br />
        A common item in a   category covered by your policy, such as a watch, may be worth $25 or $5,000.   Because this category can vary so greatly in value, your policy may set a &quot;per   item limit.&quot;<br />
        <br />
        For example: There may be a $1,000 limit per piece of   jewelry and a $2,500 limit for all jewelry as a group. If you own a couple of   inexpensive watches, you're in great shape. If you own a watch that has   appraised for $10,000, you have an option to cover that specific watch at a   higher amount. <br />
        <br />
        If your valuables exceed per item limits, you may want to   ask your agent about a Scheduled Personal Property coverage option to better   protect more valuable items.<br />

        <h2>Insuring Groups of   Valuable Items</h2>
        You can use an Optional Coverage to raise the   group limit on a category covered by your policy, such as computers or you can   use it to insure an entire category of items that are not covered by your policy   because they are less commonly owned. <br />
        <br />

            <p><span class="subtitle_s">3. Liability Insurance</span></p>

        If someone accuses you of causing harm, it helps to have support in defending   yourself. Discover how liability insurance can help protect your savings in the   event of a lawsuit resulting from a covered loss.
        <div jquery1294850435186="13">
        <p>Keep Your Family - and Your Assets -   Safe<br />
        Liability Insurance helps protect you against the financial   uncertainty arising from injury (or property damage) that you or your family may   cause to other people. It typically even covers injuries whether they happen on   or away from your property.<br />
        <h2>What Does Liability   Insurance Cover?</h2>
        In the event that you or anyone in your   household is accused of accidentally causing injury or damage to property, your   insurance coverage can help by providing for legal defense fees and, in the   event of a settlement or judgment, can pay damages (up to your policy   limit).<br />
        <br />
        Imagine if you didn't have liability insurance. Any of your   following assets could be at stake:
        <ul>
            <li>Retirement accounts (IRA, 401(k),   pension plans)</li>
            <li>Non-retirement investments (stocks, bonds, mutual   funds)</li>
            <li>Liquid assets (checking, savings, CDs, money market   accounts)</li>
            <li>Personal property (actual value of all your possessions if you   sold them: cars, boats, jewelry, furniture, etc.)</li>
            <li>Home and other real estate   equity
        </ul>

        Find out how your insurance can help pay for medical costs (up to policy limits)   when someone is injured in a covered loss at your home.
        <div jquery1294850435186="14">
        <h2>Protect Yourself - and Your Guests - From an   Accident Occurring at Your Home</h2>
        Guest medical coverage, included in   most residential insurance policies, provides protection for your guests, should   they be injured in or around your home accidentally.
        Typically,   policyholders with guest medical coverage can feel confident in their ability to   help pay for reasonable and necessary medical expenses (up to policy limits)   caused by accidents at your home that are not covered by liability protection. <br />
        <h2>What Types of Expenses May Be Included in Guest   Medical Coverage?</h2>
        Usually, reasonable medical expenses   incurred to resolve a medical emergency (that happened in your home or on your   property) and reimbursed include such items   as:
        <ul>
            <li>Medical</li>
            <li>Surgical</li>
            <li>X-ray</li>

        Knowing the difference between protection from a flood and a covered water loss   is essential. Get the facts about the Federal Government's National Flood   Insurance Program and insurance options for other water damage.
        <div jquery1294850435186="15" sizcache="0" sizset="13">
        <h2>Rising Waters Require   Special Coverage</h2>
        Floods and flash floods can occur anytime, anywhere,   in all 50 states on coasts, in the mountains, along rivers and in the middle   of the desert. In fact, roughly 25% of all flood insurance claims come from   areas not considered high risk.<br />
        <h2>How Can You   Protect Against Flood Damage?</h2>
        The Federal Government runs a   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is why most home and property   insurance typically doesn't cover flooding.<br />
        <br />
        The government draws a Flood   Hazard Boundary Map that divides the country into flood zone risk areas, and   their Flood Insurance Rate Map sets the coverage and premiums for those areas. <br />
        <br />
        You can enter your address at <a href="www.floodsmart.gov">www.floodsmart.gov</a> to find out your   risk<br />
        <h2>How Can You Protect Against &quot;Non-Flood&quot; Water   Damage?</h2>
        You may need to consider additional water backup   insurance. Neither the NFIP, nor your base homeowner's policy, will typically   cover water thatbacks up through sewers or drains or overflows from a sump pump. .
