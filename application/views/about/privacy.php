<p><span class="subtitle_s">Definitions in this Privacy Policy</span></p>

<p>We never sell, rent or trade your Personal Information.<br>
We will NEVER share our information to third party company<br><br>

Where it is necessary for a third party to assist us in providing our services, for example, reinsurers, insurance intermediaries, insurance reference bureaus, lawyers, accountants, loss adjusters and others involved in the claims handling process where you have provided your consent - which may be given expressly or may reasonably be implied by your conduct.</span></p>

<p><span class="subtitle_s">Personal Information we collect, how and why we use it</span></p>

<p>The Personal Information we collect depends on the products and services you use or apply for. Typically the details we collect and hold include your name, contact details (address, phone and fax number, email address) date of birth, gender and payment details. We may also collect information that is specific to a particular product.<br><br>

We do not collect 'Sensitive Information' unless it is necessary for the purposes of determining risk or for providing you with a specific product or service. In this event we collect Sensitive Information in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.<br><br>

Where possible, you have the option of interacting with us anonymously. For example, you may visit and browse our website and use some of our online facilities without having to reveal any Personal Information.<br><br>

We collect your Personal Information from you in various ways and at several different points. We may collect your Personal Information on our web site, by telephone, facsimile, when you complete an application form for one of our products or services and forward it to our attention, enter a competition or voluntarily participate in a survey.<br><br>

Wherever possible, we collect your Personal Information directly from you. There may, however, be occasions where we collect your Personal Information from someone else. For example, where you make an application in joint names, where it is provided to us by a third party with your consent or where we need to obtain information from professional experts for the purposes of assessing a claim or providing you with insurance cover.<br><br>

If you provide Personal Information to us about another person, we rely on you to have made or make them aware that you will, or may, provide their information to us and the types of third parties we may provide it to, the relevant purposes we and any of the third parties will use it for and how they can access it. If it is Sensitive Information we rely on you to have obtained their consent on these matters. If you have not done, or will not do, either of these things, you must tell us before you provide the relevant Personal Information.<br><br>

A number of interactive tools or facilities may be available on our web sites. If you use any of these tools or facilities, we generally do not collect your Personal Information unless a particular tool permits you to suspend or save information and recover those details at a later time. In these circumstances, your Personal Information may be retained on our systems but is not processed or used by us except that it may be used for the purposes of online quoting and subsequent follow up.<br><br>

From time to time we may request Personal Information from you through competitions or surveys. Participation in these competitions or surveys is completely voluntary and you, therefore, have the choice of whether or not you disclose the Personal Information requested.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle_s">If we deny you access we will let you know why</span></p>
